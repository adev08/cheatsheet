Key Concepts

    DTO:
        Used to expose only necessary information to the client.
        Decouples persistence logic from the API layer.

    Mapper:
        Converts between Entity and DTO for seamless data transformation.
        MapStruct is efficient and avoids manual boilerplate.

    Service:
        Handles business logic and delegates data persistence to the repository.

    Controller:
        Exposes REST endpoints for CRUD operations and delegates work to the service layer.
